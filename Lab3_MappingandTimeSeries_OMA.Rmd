Explore and normalize data by state

```{r}
#look at first couple observations
head(pubrev)

#count distinct universities per state
#doing this to normalize the revenues by state
univ_counts <- pubrev %>%
  distinct(State, Institution.Name) %>% 
  count(State, name = "Num_Universities")  

#view result
print(univ_counts)
```

Get new dataframe ready for mapping

```{r}
#summarize to mean revenue per state
state_revenue <- pubrev %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarize(rev_ag = mean(Revenue, na.rm = TRUE))
View(state_revenue)

#join the count column with og dataframe
rev_with_counts <- state_revenue %>%

#avg revenue per number of universities
rev_with_counts$avg_unirev <-

sum(rev_with_counts$Num_Universities)

#fix the first row by inputting it as alaska

Start mapping

#cleaner map

    name = "Average Revenue per State", 
    label = dollar_format(scale = 1e-8 , suffix = "B", prefix = "$"),
